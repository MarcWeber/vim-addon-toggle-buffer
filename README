  C/C++ and the like
  .h .hh <-> .c .cc .cpp .cxx

  ocaml
  .ml <-> .mli


== implemntation details ==

  a global dict keeps a list of functions which return alternate files.
  A mode is passed to the function, so that you can change its behaviour from
  "return most likely matches only" to "return all possible matches"

  The functions are expected to return string(filename).
  Maybe returning file locations is allowed as well in the future.

  Each function is added to a dict so that no duplicates occur and so that you
  can update entries easily


== notes ==
  depends on vim-addon-manager because of DefineAndBind()
